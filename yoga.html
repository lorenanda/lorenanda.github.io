<h2>Group yoga classes</h2>
<p>Join weekend yoga classes online, from the comfort of your home.</p>

    <li><strong>Sundays 7pm</strong> &#8594; gentle hatha/yin stretches, to help you wind down before a good night's sleep.</li>
</ul>

<p>These classes are donation-based. Times are UTC+1/CET.</p>

<h2>Private yoga classes</h2>
