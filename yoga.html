<h2>My yoga journey</h2>
<p>
    In 2013 I attended my first yoga class; in 2023 I taught my first class.
    The reason that led me to the first class both as a student and teacher (and to other spiritual experiences in-between) is the same: a desire to understand myself better, and ultimately to share the knowledge with others.
</p>
<p>
    Over the years I've tried out many styles of yoga, but the ones I resonate with most are Ashtanga, Hatha, and Yin.
    Besides yoga, I've also practiced gymnastics, skiing, swimming, surfing, scuba diving, running, karate, and competitive kendo.
    All sports have taught me to listen to my body and discipline my mind, and made me realize that yoga and meditation are essential for improving performance.
</p>
<p>I am continuously developing my yoga practice and teaching skills, so that I can better support and guide others.</p>
