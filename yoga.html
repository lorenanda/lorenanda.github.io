    specializing in restorative and special needs yoga.
    I can guide you to connect with your body and find inner balance.

    You can book a class using the form below. 
</p>

<h2>Group yoga classes</h2>
<p>Join weekend yoga classes online, from the comfort of your home.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Saturdays 10am</strong> &#8594; dynamic hatha/vinyasa flows, to give you a boost of positive energy for the day ahead.</li>
    <li><strong>Sundays 7pm</strong> &#8594; gentle hatha/yin stretches, to help you wind down before a good night's sleep.</li>
</ul>

<p>These classes are donation-based. Times are UTC+1/CET.</p>

<h2>Private yoga classes</h2>
<p>I offer private classes online and in Berlin.</p>
<p>In a 1:1 session you have my undivided attention:
    I tailor yoga sequences and meditations to your needs and wishes,
    and guide you every step of the way.
</p>
<p>You might prefer a private class if you:
    <ul>
        <li>Seek to practice and improve specific poses.</li>
        <li>Have special needs that make it uncomfortable to follow a group class.</li>
        <li>Want to explore some aspects of your life through targeted yoga and meditation.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
