Hello, world!

I am a data scientist based in Berlin. I specialize in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, striving to make sense of the world and develop useful technologies. When I’m not coding or reading, you can find me in the kendo dojo, on the yoga mat, taking photos around the world, or blogging about data projects and (non-)fiction books.

Don’t hesitate to get in touch!
