This weekend, **29th to 30th of March**, [Crush XV](https://www.facebook.com/crushXVbar/) hosted the exhibition of my favorite artist: [**Akume**.](http://artofakume.com/) He exhibited four of his sculptures: *The dull flame of desire*, *Stabat mater*, *Rex tremendae*, and *Twisted muse*. 

> My work is, in a sense, a form of aesthetical violence being forced on the viewer, an impulse to feel violence through violence and reflect.

> *AKUME*

I have photographed Akume's sculptures and every shooting was an exciting challenge, as I was trying to capture all the intricate details and materials, but also to find the right angle and lighting that would express the meaning behind each artwork.
