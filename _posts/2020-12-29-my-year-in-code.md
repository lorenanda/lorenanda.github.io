2020 has definitely been an objectively crappy year... But in terms of programming experience, this year has been by far my most productive and enriching! It was my third year of coding, and second year of doing for work. I've learned a lot on the job and through self-study, developed my Python skills and even learned two new languages. Here's how my coding year progressed:

January
-------

-   Started a new job as a student in Data Science/Analytics at a digital funeral home (it's really more exciting than it sounds).
-   Learned BigQuery on the job and improved my SQL skills.
-   Started learning JavaScript for automating Google Sheets and creating custom DataStudio visualisations.

February
--------

-   Automated boring tasks at work with Python.
-   Analysed the text and sentiment of business reviews with Python.
-   Worked for the first time with speech-to-text for data analysis, using Python and Google Cloud.

March
-----

-   Created my first chatbot with NLTK.
-   Built a simple FAQ chatbot with Rasa.
-   Learned to create a chatbot with Dialogflow.

April
-----

-   Completed two DataCamp projects in R to refresh my knowledge.
-   Enrolled in a uni course "Introduction to NLP with Python".
-   Started doing coding challenged on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/lorenanda), LeetCode, and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/datalingo).

May
---

-   Created my data-related Instagram account [@datalingo](https://www.instagram.com/datalingo/).
-   Completed the Natural Language Processing course on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/anerol/natural-language-processing).
-   Got my first coding challenges on Python and SQL for data-related job applications (and passed 2/3!).

June
----

-   Started creating my Data Science portfolio on GitHub. [`check it out`](https://github.com/lorenanda)
-   Created several short programs for automating various tasks. [`check it out`](https://github.com/lorenanda/task-automation)
-   Completed home assignments on Python and NLP for the uni course "NLP with Python".

July
----

-   Used GitLab (instead of GitHub) for a team project.
-   Completed a uni team project on sentiment analysis of German product reviews. [`check it out`](https://github.com/lorenanda/Sentimentanalyse-HU-SS20)
-   Passed my uni course "NLP with Python"!

August
------

-   Completed my uni-related psych-verbs project, about the classification of Romanian verbs of emotion. [`check it out`](https://github.com/lorenanda/psych-verbs)

Overall, it was a pretty codeful year! I did put a tremendous amount of work into developing my programming skills and spent many nights and weekends on learning and fixing bugs. But the feeling of satisfaction I get now looking back at what I accomplished makes it all worth it. For 2021, I have many ideas for exciting personal and work projects, so I quite look forward to the new year!
