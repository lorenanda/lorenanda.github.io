<p>I'm a technical writer and data scientist with a background in linguistics and translation.
My main interests are natural language processing, computer vision, and general workflow automation.</p>
<p>When I’m not coding or reading, you can find me in the kendo dojo, on the yoga mat, or taking photos around the world.</p>
<p>On this blog I write about (non-)fiction books, data science topics, and coding projects.</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to get in touch!</p>
