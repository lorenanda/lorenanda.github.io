<p>
  I'm a technical writer and data scientist with a focus on automation and natural language processing. My academic background is in linguistics and translation, where I specialized in neuro-/psycholinguistics, language typology, and subtitling.<br>
  When I'm not coding, writing, or reading, you can find me in the kendo dojo, on the yoga mat, or taking <a href="https://deviantart.com/dontstopnow/">photos</a> around the world or in my home studio.<br>
  <a href="/tags">This blog</a> is a brain dump for all of the above: from <a href="/tags/#projects">machine learning projects</a> and <a href="/tags/#linguistics">linguistics research</a> to <a href="/tags/#books">book reviews</a> and <a href="/tags/#art">art exhibitions</a> Hope you'll find something interesting.
