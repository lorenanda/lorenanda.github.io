<p>I'm Lorena - technical writer and data scientist with a background in linguistics and translation.
My main work interests are in natural language processing, computer vision, and workflow automation.</p>
<p>Also, I like to read a lot and talk about books, especially non-fiction related to big data and artificial intelligence, as well as fiction thrillers and crime stories.</p>
<p>On <a href="/tags"> this blog</a> I write about my data science projects and thoughts on (non-)fiction books. New posts published every Sunday (more or less).</p>
<p>When I’m not coding or reading, you can find me in the kendo dojo, on the yoga mat, or taking photos around the world.</p>

If you like my content and want to support me, you can buy me a coffee to fuel my creative energy!
