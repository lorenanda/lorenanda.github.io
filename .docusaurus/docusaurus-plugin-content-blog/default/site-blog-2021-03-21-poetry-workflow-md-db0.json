  "description": "March 21st is World Poetry Day, a day dedicated to one of the most treasured ways of expression around the world and linguistic diversity. I have always loved reading poetry with creative rhymes and melodic rhythm, and lately I have come to appreciate free verse poetry as well. In any case, I would like to make time to read more poetry and discover new international poets.",
