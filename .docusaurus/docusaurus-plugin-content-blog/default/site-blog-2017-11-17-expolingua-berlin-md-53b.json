  "description": "Today I attended the long-awaited international fair for languages and cultures ExpoLingua in Berlin. It's a must event for anyone interested in language learning and teaching, because for two days (17-18 November) it brings 150+ exhibitors (language schools, travel operators, cultural institutes, publishing houses, translators, associations) from 30+ countries and offers workshops, presentations, crash-courses in different languages, performances, and moderated panel discussions, from five categories: languages and cultures, presentations for teachers, learn & travel, tests, and career.",
